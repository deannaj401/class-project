            <h2>Lord of the Rings </h2>
            <h3>by J.R.R. Tolkien</h3>
            <img class="pics" src="images/Lordoftheringsbooks.jpg" alt="Lord of the ring books">

    <p>One of the most beloved Fantasy novels in the world. The story of Frodo Baggins
                and his journey for the One Ring is epic. This series has been made into movies,
                been the subject of college classes and the inspiration for entire conventions. This
                was one of the first fantasy books I read as a child and it has always remained
                one of my favorites to this day

            <h2>Harry Potter Series</h2>
            <h3>by J.K. Rowling </h3>
            <img class="pics" src="images/hogwartscrest.png" alt="Hogwarts crest">
            <p>
                The story of Harry Potter and his adventures at Hogwarts is near and dear to
                my heart. From the very first sentence of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone to
                the final paragraph of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows the reader is drawn in
                and captured by the charm of a school for wizards along with the excitement of the story's
                darker elements. This series is loved all around the world for good reason

            <h2>The Chronicles of Narnia</h2>
            <h3>by C.S. Lewis</h3>
            <img class="pics" src="images/Narnialamppost.jpg" alt="Narnia lampost">
            <p> The chronicles of Narnia are mostly classified as a series for
                children but there are a lot of people who have spent a lot of
                time analyzing and studying this story of the magical land of Narnia.
                Some say its just a fairy tale. Others say there is a deeper religious
                meaning. Either way these books are very well written and engaging. Young
                and old alike will enjoy them.
